My name's Eugene. I love robots, music and languages.

I'm from Sydney but currently in SF!

I've worked in underwater robotics as a software engineer for the past few years, and this blog focusses mainly on that.

I also play the saxophone and have been gigging around Sydney for the past few years in the jazz/neo soul scene.

Je parle français/ich spreche Deutsch/hablo español!
